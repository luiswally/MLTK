The cheating accusations in the Call of Duty community have gotten SO bad that this guy genuinely accused me of cheating for "snapping on him with my chopper gunner".  His friend then proceeded to come to my stream, donate and ask for me to show my task manager. 🤡 https://t.co/gPl8KPcoC1

@RCardosoEU Will the commission also work to ensure that Call of Duty content that SONY HAS BEEN BLOCKING FROM ALL OTHER PLATOFRMS will be available going forward on "our" Xbox, Steam, Windows, Nintendo devices?

Once again, why are these regulators so worried about Sony’s best interests? That’s not their job. Like…at all. If a PlayStation gamer has to buy an Xbox for Call of Duty, hell wont freeze over. Same way Xbox gamers simply have to buy a PlayStation if they want Spider-man https://t.co/e7FHJV4bTd
Microsoft has been super clear about Call of Duty on PlayStation, but the European Commission continues to voice concerns. Apparently those concerns also relate to “my PlayStation” in some cases 😶 https://t.co/TiZwwr3x13

I get us more hardcore players can get tired of maps like Shoothouse or Shipment but the player retention numbers that Activision sees from maps like that are clearly very high. Casuals who work 9-5 and wanna hop on Call of Duty after work are gonna want to play maps like that.
