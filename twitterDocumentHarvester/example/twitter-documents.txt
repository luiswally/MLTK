Everyone is talking about the releases of God of War: Ragnarok and Sonic Frontiers next week, but there is another game that I'm really excited for...  Don't sleep on Tactics Ogre Reborn, one of the best SRPGs of all time! https://t.co/224rqtMlvs
It's DONE! I killed the Valkyrie Queen Sigrún in God of War with a Dance Pad. Let me tell you... This was Malenia difficulty but so much more fast-paced. Took me 216 tries and about 12 hours to kill her. The fatigue is real. Now I'm ready for #GodofWarRagnarok https://t.co/jp0A4RqFkm
@KEEMSTAR Bro god of war is out in 3 days
Taking today off! Had a blast the last 11 days on stream.  This week will be crazy!  - Filming content with 100T Monday/Tuesday - Streaming DMZ/Warzone 2.0 on Wednesday  - Streaming God of War Ragnarok on Wednesday - Friday - Road trip to watch Connor play baseball in the US

I have heard virtually nothing about the new God of War and it comes out in mere days

"God of War Ragnarok is unabashedly a PS4 Game"   "I believe a (from the ground up) PS5 version of God of War Ragnarok would not deliver a locked 60fps experience expected from the PS5"  "Playing this on PS5 feels like you're playing another multiplatform game"  - Digital Foundry https://t.co/IVey5ILX0C
My prediction is that Elden Ring will ultimately end up taking GOTY 2022, though I do think God of War Ragnarok has a real chance. https://t.co/e4PoPi4lsX

God of war Ragnarök Platinum trophy:  - 2 lists, PS4 and PS5 - 4 Gold, 15 Silver, 16 Bronze - Is mostly good mix of completions in side quests, story, collectibles etc - No difficulty trophies 💔  Will YOU Platinum it? 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶 https://t.co/KNUxoKRf5R
Each of our (artisanal, handcrafted, homemade, etc 😂) difficulty options has been designed and tuned with care and intent, along with a myriad of accessibility settings.   It is important to us at @SonySantaMonica that all players are able to fully enjoy the experience! (3/3)
The hardest difficulty 'Give Me God of War' will punish mistakes &amp; reward mastery with some gameplay twists.. and new to Ragnarok is the ability to drop down from GMGOW once you have started, though it is a one-way change. No harm in giving it a shot for the curious! (2/3)

These are two very highly acclaimed games that do deserve it. And I'd much rather (1/2) https://t.co/1WEFjmSBUR

The entire world felt it. When a new God of Death was crowned. When the new God of War was born, rising from the battlefield with an arrow still lodged in his chest.  War and Death walked hand-in-hand across the battlefield, as they were always meant to.  END:)
After centuries of wars, bloodshed, and the death that followed, the Gods had enough. Techno, God of War, and the one responsible for this mess, was exiled. He desperately appealed to his closest friend and ally, Philza, the God of Death.
Now that the embargo has lifted, I can finally say that god of war ragnarok is one of the most games ever

@Syndicate You can definitely start with God of War (2018), as the new one is a direct sequel and carrying on that story.   We do have a handy story recap in the God of War Ragnarök menu so even if you haven't had the chance to play the previous game, you can hit the ground running!

Les excellentes notes de God of War Ragnarok ! 👀 https://t.co/OzXA1dejnR
Salty Playstation fanboy decided to be racist against asian people because IGN Korea gave God of War Ragnarok 6/10. Now his account is suspended over a videogame  The moral of the story :  Don't be a racist jerk https://t.co/3i8hOFcfSK
I want a standalone game where you play as Thor from God of War Ragnarok! Story driven &amp; everything!
my favorite exchange in god of war 2018 isn't any of the major scenes; it's after atreus sees a vision of kratos killing his own father in helheim. when you're on the elevator leaving the area, kratos tries to talk to atreus about it, but atreus denies he saw anything.
God of War and Elden Ring will probably dominate Game of the Year discussion, clickbait videos, and heated discussions.  The real discussion should be just how well 2022 has turned out.
@PlayStationUK Way ahead of you 😉
@ChelseaBytes Ah!!!!! Can't wait to see it! 💙
@MartinNebelong @BlueOwlzMedic OMG! Thank you this is amazing 💙
Excited for God of War as it presents the ultimate gamer fantasy (getting your shit rocked by scandinavians)

11.  I have always been advising you to correct your course through videos, Tweets &amp; private messages. You NEVER listened because you had surrounded yourself with snakes like SMQ, MY &amp; FC.  Now you are putting this country on the path of a civil war. STOP!!! For God sake STOP!!!

God of War Ragnarok is the PERFECT game! From the writing, to the combat, to the puzzles, it is flawless...but lets talk about WHY!  NEW REVIEW, ZERO SPOILERS: https://t.co/JhM8bTCIfk https://t.co/f2hkfGLLzK
That feeling when you are about to platinum #GodofWar before Ragnarok 🔥 https://t.co/AyoniENC6J
Modern Warfare 2 launch sales out performed the opening weekend of Top Gun: Maverick. God of War: Ragnarok is looking like it’s the Game of the Year, maybe Game of the Decade. The entire landscape of our medium will benefit from the existence of high quality, tent-pole games.
Where is our God of War review, you ask? https://t.co/dDx0g39u7Y
AYO 🏃🏾💨 @SonySantaMonica @PlayStation thank you for the review code 😭😭 https://t.co/gGbZgZZked
Finally. It's time to play God of War everyone's been talking about. https://t.co/SEyVWSYv9c
how many would actually be interested in a God of War Ragnarok playthrough. I’d get the game in New Zealand time and see if we can grind it out in one mega stream
Last time I reached out &amp; actually got a response from Sony for a review code was with God of War...  I was told that my video reviews didn't perform as well as my "hype" content so they didn't see enough reason to give early access lmao https://t.co/aQ7NDQ4Zt3
God of War is one of the best IPs in the entire video game industry 🏆  Thanks to @SonySantaMonica, @corybarlog, and all the people involved in the development of these masterpieces 💙 https://t.co/QjbWhUzkbD

congrats to our friends at @SonySantaMonica on the awesome #GodofWarRagnarok reviews!!!
Be honest please, do you think I deserve a review code for God of war Ragnarök? https://t.co/bTcvNVFIo5
God is the Source of peace and never brings about war, hatred, or violence. We, who believe in Him, are called to promote peace through encounter, patient negotiations and dialogue, which is the oxygen of peaceful coexistence. #ApostolicJourney
@bulamabukarti We screamed. We warned. Una tell us say he was God sent. We warned of his history &amp; antecedents. Dem turn am to Tribal war. Now its Tears, Bloodshed &amp; Anguish everywhere. We are warning again about the 2 old Baba dey want to put. Many people no wan hear. Tomorrow story will start
@SonySantaMonica Congrats on #GodofWarRagnarok - looks like it's getting a great reception!
I have no doubt the new God of War is going to be amazing. I am going to buy it and probably play the hell out of it.   Yet oddly I find myself not that excited for it. Weird, because I loved the first one. Such an odd feeling, anybody else ever have this with a game?
Sony Santa Monica Studio has revealed over 70 accessibility options that will ship with God of War Ragnarök on November 9. https://t.co/81gOU8gtoL
#GodofWarRagnarok is my GOTY. The accessibility is revolutionary, the narrative is superb &amp; the combat is thrilling.  I want to thank the whole @SonySantaMonica team for their faultless work delivering an epic conclusion to the Norse saga.   https://t.co/dR9oMOW61a
God of War  5 days until #GodofWarRagnarok https://t.co/x7aTvowXgb
I dare my fellow video essayists to say “Ragnarök” with a swedish pronunciation (every time) in the God of War videos you’ll inevitably make.
God of War Ragnarok makes the last game look like a prologue. Its outrageous scope and creativity make it a masterpiece, even by PlayStation Studios' high standards. https://t.co/U3HLZBdTp6 #Repost #Reviews #Sony #PS5 #GodofWarRagnarok https://t.co/5VavppUjpe
